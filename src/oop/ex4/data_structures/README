  1. What is the asymptotic running time complexity of the tree construction done in AvlTree(int[] data)?
    O(nlogn). We iterate over each array member - O(n), and add it using the add function which in a balanced tree
    is O(logn). Our total time complexity is: O(n*logn).
  2. If we get an ordered array - we can add all nodes in O(n).
         This is the best possible outcome, because we have to iterate over all array members to add them - that is
         O(n).

  1. What is the asymptotic running time complexity of the tree construction done in AvlTree(AvlTree avlTree)?
    O(n). Our algorithm has two parts:
      a. Getting a number from the iterator. When initialized does O(n) actions to create an ordered array.
      b. Adding to the tree each member is O(1), as it's only determining the reference in another node.
      For n nodes - that is O(n).
    When summing we get O(n) time complexity.
  2. If we get an ordered array - we can add all nodes in O(n).
    This is the best possible outcome, because we have to iterate over all array members to add them - that is
    O(n).
